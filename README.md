- Compiler: gcc (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0

## About the game
This is the most complex project I have created as a first year college student an I believe it simulates really well what a coffee shop owner has to do(excepting the boring bureaucracy), it implements supply and demand, season changes, expenses and a few other things that you have to discover by yourself. I spent 4 hours a day for three full weeks in order to complete this project and I am personally very proud of how it turned out, if you decide to try it out, thank you.(NOTE: THE ORIGINAL GAME, WHICH IS ON MY PC, EVEN HAS MUSIC BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE SONGS ON YOUR COMPUTER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE YOU DONWLOAND MORE FILES)

## How to play the game
### 1. [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 and the [GCC Compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)(Windows 10 is necessary)
### 2. Put all the files(headers and source code) inside the same folder
### 3. Compile `TheCafeSim_NoMusic.cpp` and then run `TheCafeSim_NoMusic.exe` that was created in the folder

Mechanics:
- **Map mode**: WASD to move, you are the smily face, ! is your enemy, % is the wheel of fortune which you may or may not spin, ? is a surprise, go to ! or ? to enter the *Battle Mode*
- **Battle mode**: Choose the action you would like to do, your Ultimate has a cooldown, you have limited mana and health, win fights to earn prizes and boost your stats, wining a ? battle gives you a special prize
