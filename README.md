# TheCafeSim
This is a simulator in which you are a coffee shop owner and your goal is making your business as succesful as possible.

## Software used for this project
- Visual Studio Code version: 1.77.0 and Visual Studio 2022
- Compiler: gcc (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0

## About the game
This is the most complex project I have created as a first year college student and I believe it simulates really well what a coffee shop owner has to do(except the boring bureaucracy). Game mechanics I implemented: supply and demand, prices that change accordingly in winter and summer seasons, handling expenses (rent, salaries, supply, etc), bankruptcy and a few other things that you have to discover for yourself. I spent 4 hours a day for three full weeks in order to complete this project and I am personally very proud of how it turned out, if you decide to try it out, thank you.

*(NOTE: The original game, which is on my computer, has music included. This version comes without music due to the user having to download the music files and I don't want to make you download more files than needed)*

## How to play the game
### 1. [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 and the [GCC Compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)(Windows 10 is necessary)
### 2. Put all the files(headers and source code) inside the same folder
### 3. Compile `TheCafeSim_NoMusic.cpp` and then run `TheCafeSim_NoMusic.exe` that was created in the folder

## Mechanics:
- There isn't much to say about mechanincs, as I have already left some tips(I encourage you to read them, they are really helpful) at the beginning of the game, just treat it like it's a real coffee shop and see if your decisions will find success.
