## About the game
This is the most complex project I have created as a first year college student an I believe in to be one of the most accurate , I spent about two weeks on it's full development and all the changes I made along the way. It is like the Pokemon RPG games, but very simple. There are few mechanics like moving, attacking, healing, using a lucky wheel. 

## How to play the game
### 1. [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 and the [GCC Compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)(Windows 10 is necessary)
### 2. Put all 4 files inside the same folder
### 3. Compile `TypeAdventurer.cpp` and then run `TypeAdventurer.exe` that was created in the folder

Mechanics:
- **Map mode**: WASD to move, you are the smily face, ! is your enemy, % is the wheel of fortune which you may or may not spin, ? is a surprise, go to ! or ? to enter the *Battle Mode*
- **Battle mode**: Choose the action you would like to do, your Ultimate has a cooldown, you have limited mana and health, win fights to earn prizes and boost your stats, wining a ? battle gives you a special prize
